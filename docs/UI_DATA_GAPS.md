# UI Data Gaps

This is a running list of data points shown in the v2 UI designs that we **do not currently have wired up** (or do not appear to exist in the database/codebase yet).

## Home (COMPANION)

- **Highlighted text spans by category**: colored highlights for phrases in the narrative (e.g. HRV/sleep, threshold run, deep work). Need a data model for “annotated narrative” (spans + category) or a deterministic highlighter.
- **Narrative content**: the multi-paragraph morning briefing copy itself (currently generated by agents/workflows, but not exposed as a dedicated “home briefing” payload).
- **Pre-run snack calories**: explicit target calories for snack (design uses 200). We can approximate via nutrition logic but do not store a specific value today.
- **Pre-run snack tags**: “Quick Energy”, “Muscle Support” tag taxonomy.
- **Journal entry CTA state**: whether an entry exists for today, and where to store journal entries.
- **Health tips list**: explicit tips for the day (design shows a dedicated panel). We can generate but need a place to persist and fetch.

## Run / Fitness (RUN-COMPANION)

- **Month miles run**: e.g. 45 miles this month. *(We can compute from completed run workouts; just needs final UI wiring.)*
- **Year miles run**: e.g. 984 miles this year. *(We can compute from completed run workouts; just needs final UI wiring.)*
- **Fitness metrics panel**:
  - **Running Lactate Threshold (RLT)**: BPM + pace/duration context.
  - **VO2Max**: value + label (e.g. “Elite”).
  - **Training Readiness**: composite score with contributing factors.
  - **Load Focus**: aerobic / high aerobic / anaerobic balance values.
- **Shoe rotation card data**: per-shoe miles run + classification (e.g. Long Run / Daily Trainer / Race Shoe) and “fresh/elite” labels.
- **Calendar left rail**: “tempo run complete” state, plus scrollable calendar grouping with status.
- **Chat panel prepopulation**: page-specific AI summary that updates by time of day and new activity (needs a stored/servable “run companion summary”).

## Notes
- If a gap is actually already in Supabase but not yet queried, we should move it out of this list once confirmed.
