# Marathon Training Knowledge Base

Expert guidance for marathon training, from base building through race day.

## Training Phases

### Base Building (Weeks 1-4)
- **Focus**: Aerobic development, injury prevention
- **Volume**: 70-80% of peak mileage
- **Intensity Distribution**: 80% easy, 20% moderate
- **Key Workouts**: Long runs at conversational pace
- **Goal**: Build consistent mileage foundation

### Build Phase (Weeks 5-12)
- **Focus**: Lactate threshold, VO2max development
- **Volume**: Building to peak mileage
- **Key Workouts**:
  - Tempo runs: 20-40 min at marathon pace + 20-30 sec/mile
  - Intervals: 6-8 x 800m at 5K pace with 90s recovery
  - Progressive long runs with MP segments
- **Goal**: Develop race-specific fitness

### Peak Phase (Weeks 13-16)
- **Focus**: Race-specific fitness, confidence building
- **Volume**: Peak then begin taper
- **Key Workouts**:
  - Race-pace long runs (14-16 mi with 8-10 at MP)
  - Tune-up races (10K to half marathon)
  - Marathon-specific intervals
- **Goal**: Sharpen fitness, practice race execution

### Taper (Final 2-3 weeks)
- **Volume Reduction**: 40-60% of peak
- **Maintain intensity, reduce duration**
- **Focus on rest, nutrition, and mental preparation**
- **Goal**: Arrive at start line fresh and ready

## Pace Zone Calculations

See [PACING.md](PACING.md) for detailed pace zone calculations based on goal time.

## Recovery and Adaptation

See [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md) for HRV, RHR, and sleep analysis guidelines.

## Race Day Strategy

See [RACE_DAY.md](RACE_DAY.md) for pacing strategy, nutrition timing, and execution tips.

## Workout Types Reference

| Workout | Purpose | Typical Pace | Duration |
|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Easy Run | Recovery, aerobic base | 60-90 sec slower than MP | 30-60 min |
| Long Run | Endurance, fat adaptation | 45-90 sec slower than MP | 90-180 min |
| Tempo | Lactate threshold | MP to MP+20 sec | 20-45 min |
| Intervals | VO2max, speed | 5K-10K pace | 3-6 mi total |
| Progression | Finishing speed | Easy to MP | 8-12 mi |
| Recovery | Active recovery | Very easy | 20-30 min |

## Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Resting HR**: Baseline +3 bpm = fatigue signal
2. **HRV**: Trending down = accumulated stress
3. **Training Load Ratio**: Acute/Chronic target 0.8-1.3
4. **Sleep**: <7 hours consistently = adaptation impairment
5. **HR at Pace**: Increasing HR at same pace = fatigue
