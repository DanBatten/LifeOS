# Race Day Execution Guide

## Pre-Race Timeline

### Week Before
- **Mon-Wed**: Normal easy running, reduced volume
- **Thu**: Short shakeout (2-3 mi with strides)
- **Fri**: Rest or very easy 20 min
- **Sat (race eve)**: Light walk, early dinner, early bed

### Day Before
- **Meals**: Familiar foods, moderate carbs, avoid fiber
- **Hydration**: Normal (don't overhydrate)
- **Activity**: Light walking, stay off feet
- **Sleep**: Aim for 8+ hours; don't stress if less

### Race Morning
- **Wake up**: 3-4 hours before start
- **Breakfast**: Practiced, familiar (toast, banana, etc.)
- **Last calories**: 60-90 min before start
- **Last bathroom**: 30-45 min before start
- **Warmup**: 10-15 min light jog + dynamic stretches

## Nutrition Strategy

### Night Before
- Moderate carb dinner (pasta, rice, bread)
- Avoid new/spicy foods
- Limit fiber and fat
- Hydrate normally

### Race Morning
- 300-500 calories, 2-4 hours before
- Mostly carbs, low fiber/fat
- Examples: bagel + peanut butter, oatmeal, banana

### During Race
**Under 3:30 Goal**:
- Gel every 45-50 min starting at mile 4-5
- Target 60g carbs/hour
- Water at every other station

**Over 3:30 Goal**:
- Gel every 50-60 min starting at mile 5-6
- Can alternate gel/sports drink
- Water at most stations

### Gel Timing Example (3:00 Marathon)
- Mile 5 (~35 min): First gel
- Mile 10 (~70 min): Second gel
- Mile 15 (~105 min): Third gel
- Mile 20 (~140 min): Fourth gel (if needed)

## Pacing Execution

### Miles 1-5: Controlled Start
- **Feel**: Easy, almost too slow
- **Goal**: Run 5-10 sec/mi slower than goal pace
- **Avoid**: Getting swept up in crowd excitement
- **Mantra**: "Bank time later, not now"

### Miles 6-13: Settle In
- **Feel**: Comfortable, sustainable
- **Goal**: Gradually move to goal pace
- **Focus**: Rhythm, form, relaxation
- **Check**: HR should be steady, not climbing

### Miles 14-20: Work Phase
- **Feel**: Working but controlled
- **Goal**: Maintain goal pace
- **Focus**: One mile at a time, stay present
- **Warning signs**: If HR spiking, slow slightly

### Miles 21-26.2: The Push
- **Feel**: Challenging but manageable
- **Goal**: Maintain or negative split
- **Focus**: Break into segments (21-23, 23-25, 25-finish)
- **Mental game**: Draw on training, crowds, why you're here

## Mental Strategies

### Mantras
- "Smooth and strong"
- "Relentless forward progress"
- "I trained for this"
- "One mile at a time"

### Segmentation
Don't think about 26.2 miles:
- Think in 5K chunks
- "Just get to the next aid station"
- "10K to go is just a Tuesday tempo"

### Managing the Wall (Miles 18-22)
- Expected: fatigue will increase dramatically
- Strategy: shorten focus, maintain form
- Fuel: critical to have carbs on board
- Crowds: use them for energy boosts

## Troubleshooting

### Too Fast Early
- Slow immediately (don't wait)
- Accept the mistake, minimize damage
- Focus on even effort, not pace recovery

### Side Stitch
- Slow slightly, exhale forcefully
- Press on affected side
- Usually resolves in 1-2 minutes

### Cramping
- Walk briefly if severe
- Stretch while moving if possible
- Take salt/electrolytes if available
- Often means too fast too early

### Bonking (Out of Energy)
- Walk aid stations, jog between
- Take every gel/food offered
- Goal shifts to finishing, not time
- Prevention: don't skip fueling

## Weather Adjustments

### Hot (>70°F)
- Adjust goal +5-10% slower
- Take water at every station
- Pour water on head/neck
- Prioritize finishing over time

### Cold (<40°F)
- Dress in layers (can discard)
- Arm warmers: easy to remove
- Start conservative (muscles cold)

### Windy
- Shelter behind groups when possible
- Expect slower splits into wind
- Don't chase lost time immediately

### Rain
- Vaseline on prone areas
- Wear hat with brim
- Dry socks at mile 13 (if feasible)
- Embrace it, everyone's dealing with it
