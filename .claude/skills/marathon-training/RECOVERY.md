# Recovery and Adaptation Guide

## Key Recovery Metrics

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
- **Normal variation**: ±2-3 bpm day-to-day
- **Warning sign**: +5 bpm above baseline for 2+ days
- **Action if elevated**:
  - Reduce intensity, keep volume low
  - Prioritize sleep and hydration
  - If persists 3+ days: rest day

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- **Normal**: Track 7-day rolling average
- **Warning sign**: 10%+ drop below baseline average
- **Interpretation**:
  - Low HRV = accumulated stress (training + life)
  - Single low day: proceed with caution
  - Trending down: reduce training load

### Sleep Quality
- **Target**: 7-9 hours per night
- **Warning sign**: <6 hours for 3+ consecutive nights
- **Impact on training**:
  - Poor sleep = impaired recovery
  - Skip hard workouts if sleep-deprived
  - Naps can help but don't fully compensate

### Training Load Ratio (Acute:Chronic)
- **Optimal range**: 0.8-1.3
- **Risk zones**:
  - <0.8: Detraining, losing fitness
  - >1.3: Elevated injury risk
  - >1.5: High injury risk, reduce immediately

## Recovery Protocols

### After Easy Runs
- Minimal recovery needed
- Normal eating and hydration
- Continue regular activities

### After Long Runs (>90 min)
1. **First 30 minutes**:
   - Refuel with carbs + protein (3:1 ratio)
   - Rehydrate (16-24 oz)
   - Light stretching or foam rolling
2. **Same day**:
   - Avoid prolonged standing
   - Elevate legs if possible
   - Protein-rich meal within 2 hours
3. **Next day**:
   - Easy run or complete rest
   - Extra sleep if possible
   - Monitor soreness

### After Hard Workouts (Tempo/Intervals)
1. **Cooldown**: 10-15 min easy jog
2. **Stretch**: Dynamic or static (5-10 min)
3. **Refuel**: Similar to long runs
4. **Next day**: Easy run only, monitor fatigue

## Red Flags Requiring Rest

### Stop Training If:
- Sharp or localized pain (vs general soreness)
- Pain that worsens during running
- Same area hurting 3+ consecutive runs
- Fever or illness symptoms
- RHR elevated +10 bpm

### Modify Training If:
- RHR elevated +5 bpm
- HRV trending down for 3+ days
- Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep
- Motivation significantly low
- General muscle soreness not recovering

## Adaptation Timeline

### After Volume Increase
- **Absorption time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Fitness gain visible**: 3-4 weeks
- **Don't increase again until absorbed**

### After Intensity Block
- **Recovery needed**: 1-2 easy weeks
- **Performance peak**: 10-14 days after block

### Taper Timeline
- **2-week taper**: Maintain intensity, cut volume 40%
- **3-week taper**: Gradual 20%→40%→60% reduction
- **Freshness peak**: Days 10-14 of taper

## Weekly Recovery Rhythm

**Recommended Pattern**:
```
Mon: Easy or Rest
Tue: Quality workout
Wed: Easy
Thu: Moderate or Quality
Fri: Easy or Rest
Sat: Long run
Sun: Easy or Rest
```

- 2-3 quality sessions per week max
- At least 1 full rest day
- Easy days must be truly easy (recovery pace)
